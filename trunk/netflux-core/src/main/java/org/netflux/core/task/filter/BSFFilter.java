 * Scripting language based filter using the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">Bean Scripting Framework</a>. Thanks to the use
 * of <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/">BSF</a> you may use this class to implement a filter using one of the many BSF
 * supported scripting languages (Java, Javascript, Python, Groovy,...).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to use this filter, you must provide an scripting language to use and an expression written in that language that will be
 * evaluated for every record. The result of the evaluation will determine acceptance or rejection of the corresponding record. The
 * {@link org.netflux.core.Field field}s of the record will be made available to the scripting engine, so they may be accessed in the
 * following way: <code>nameOfField.value</code>.
